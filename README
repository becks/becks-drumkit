Here my first drumkit for hydrogen, maybe is not yet ready, but anywayâ€¦

The drum is a ludwig epic jazz 100years series, and the cymbals are zildjian K series.

I used shure sm57 for snare, and rhodes nt1a for others samples (and sp vtb1 as a preamp). No effetcs, no compressor, no verb, nothing.

Here you can download the first alpha version
